# University-Activity-Updates-with-SMS-Notification-PHP-PDO-
If you are looking for an Online Activity Updates Management System that has an SMS notification? Then you are at the right place. The main aim of this project is to make sure that every time the University has an activity every student will be notified by an SMS notification. In that way, the students will have an idea if the University has upcoming activities that need the participation of every student. And that includes the time and location of the activity. In this management System, the admin has the access to create activities or events and relay it to the students through online.
